## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge was easy, with the design being pretty much the same on both mobile and CSS.
I worked with the idea of mobile-first, as I wanted to write code that easily adapts to larger screens.
I centered the box with the image and text with Flexbox, and I put a box size variation for smaller screens with 90% of width, and the larger screens were with an absolute width (332px)

### Continued development

I need to improve my knowledge of Flexbox, which at the moment is basic, and of media query, because I want to make projects that adapt better to all types of screens.
