## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a very easy project to do. As the layout does not vary the width of the box with the text, I set a width with an absolute unit of 332px and centered this box with the help of Flexbox.

### Continued development

I need to improve my knowledge of Flexbox, which at the moment is basic, and of media query, because I want to make projects that adapt better to all types of screens.
